Restaurants can be found using `/search` together with a query. Search queries can be composed of multiples words such as "Pizzeria Sants". The `/find` command will find restaurants which are a result to all the words in the query. 
Logical expressions can be used.  The supported operators are `and`, `or` and `not`. Queries are in preorder format. An example is 
`/find and(frankfurt,and(Pedralbes,not(Sants)))`.

The command `/info N` ()where N is the restaurant number in the search results) allows you to get detailed information about the restaurant.
